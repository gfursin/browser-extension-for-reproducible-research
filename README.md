**Purpose:** Finding or sharing knowledge about research papers, code, portable workflows and reusable artifacts for a given web page.

**Link:** https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/collective-knowledge

**Notes:**

This browser extension helps you to find if a given web page has related research papers,
code, portable workflows, state-of-the-art scoreboards, and reusable DevOps components 
for AI, ML and other emerging technologies. 

The goal is to help researchers and practitioners find, test, reproduce
and adopt novel techniques presented on web pages. You can also add your
own links with relevant information for a given web page as well as rank
the relevance of existing ones.

We regularly index 1M+ URLs from Arxiv, GitHub, GitLab, paperswithcode, Zenodo, 
ACM DL, and continue adding new links weekly. You can also use our search engine 
at [cKnowledge.io](https://cKnowledge.io) .

**Test:** Please, navigate to the [MobileNets ArXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) to test this extension.
